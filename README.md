## Usage
To use this plugin, add `mlkit` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.io/platform-plugins/).

## Getting Started

Check out the `example` directory for a sample app using Firebase Cloud Messaging.

### Android Integration

To integrate your plugin into the Android part of your app, follow these steps:

1. Using the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) add an Android app to your project: Follow the assistant, download the generated `google-services.json` file and place it inside `android/app`. Next, modify the `android/build.gradle` file and the `android/app/build.gradle` file to add the Google services plugin as described by the Firebase assistant.

### iOS Integration

To integrate your plugin into the iOS part of your app, follow these steps:

1. Using the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) add an iOS app to your project: Follow the assistant, download the generated `GoogleService-Info.plist` file, open `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` with Xcode, and within Xcode place the file inside `ios/Runner`. **Don't** follow the steps named "Add Firebase SDK" and "Add initialization code" in the Firebase assistant.

1. Remove the `use_frameworks!` line from `ios/Podfile` (workaround for [flutter/flutter#9694](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/9694)).

### Dart/Flutter Integration

From your Dart code, you need to import the plugin and instantiate it:

```dart
import 'package:mlkit/mlkit.dart';

FirebaseVisionTextDetector detector = FirebaseVisionTextDetector.instance;

var currentLabels = await detector.detectFromPath(_file?.path);
```
